# Ambience audio dataset

## Overview

This dataset was generated by scraping videos from prominent YouTube channels focused on ambient audio. The dataset includes a collection of videos that feature various ambient sounds, such as nature sounds, relaxing music, and environmental noises. For each video, essential metadata was extracted, and a caption was generated using an AI model to enhance the discoverability of the content. This dataset can be useful in various applications, such as building a vector database for efficient search, machine learning tasks, or simply organizing ambient audio content.

## Dataset Contents

The dataset consists of the following fields:

- **`id`**: A unique youtube identifier for each video 
- **`title`**: The title of the video, which usually describes the type of ambient sound featured.
- **`thumbnailUrl`**: The URL of the videoâ€™s thumbnail, which provides a visual representation of the content.
- **`caption`**: A generated caption that describes the ambiance of the audio, making it easier to search and categorize.

### Example Record

```json
{
    "id": "vv_OXBHrgDQ",
    "title": "Nature Sounds for Sleeping, Summer Night Pond Ambience, Soft Frogs and Crickets",
    "thumbnailUrl": "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/vv_OXBHrgDQ/hqdefault.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEbCKgBEF5IVfKriqkDDggBFQAAiEIYAXABwAEG&rs=AOn4CLAKqCC6AO-V2bUCMnoD0tRarR2LrA",
    "caption": "Pond night sounds with frogs and crickets."
}
```

## How the Dataset Was Generated

1. **Scraping YouTube Videos**: 
   - Videos were scraped from top YouTube channels specializing in ambient audio. These channels typically feature sounds that are designed to relax, meditate, focus, or sleep.

2. **Extracting Metadata**: 
   - For each video, essential metadata was extracted, including the video ID, title, and thumbnail URL. These elements are critical for identifying and displaying the content.

3. **Generating Captions**:
   - The titles and thumbnails were fed into the GPT-4 mini model to generate descriptive captions for each video. These captions provide a summary of the ambiance conveyed by the audio, improving searchability and classification within databases.

4. **Filtering Incomplete Data**:
   - Only records with all required fields (id, title, thumbnailUrl, and caption) were included in the final dataset. Incomplete records were discarded to ensure the integrity and usefulness of the dataset.

## Use Cases

This dataset can be applied in various domains, including but not limited to:

- **Vector Databases**: By using the captions and titles, the dataset can be indexed in a vector database, enabling efficient and relevant search results for users looking for specific types of ambient sounds.
  
- **Content Recommendation Systems**: The dataset can help in building recommendation systems that suggest related ambient audio content based on user preferences.
  
- **Machine Learning Projects**: The dataset can be used for training machine learning models in tasks like caption generation, video classification, or audio categorization.
  
- **Content Organization**: Useful for individuals or organizations looking to categorize and organize large collections of ambient audio for ease of access.

## How to Use the Dataset

1. **Loading the Dataset**:
   - The dataset is provided in CSV format. You can load it using common data manipulation libraries such as pandas in Python:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   df = pd.read_csv('output.csv')
   ```

2. **Search and Indexing**:
   - Utilize the captions to index the dataset in a vector database, allowing for efficient similarity search.

3. **Custom Applications**:
   - Feel free to integrate this dataset into your own applications, whether it be for personal projects or larger-scale systems.
